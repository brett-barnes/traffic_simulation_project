This was the final project made by Jack DuPuy and I for our sophomore year C++ course. To compile it, use the command make. To run it, enter ./Simulation with two arguments: an input probabilities file (the file sample1 is included with reasonable probabilities, this file can be altered to test), and an input seed. Running the simulation with the same probabilities and seed will result in the same output.
